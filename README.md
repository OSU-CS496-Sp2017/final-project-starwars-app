CS 496 Final Project: Star Wars App

Team: Pranav Ramesh, Braden Ackles, Chase Coltman, Zach Torres

Project Description:

Our project is to use the Star Wars API to list all the People, Vehicles and Planets in the
universe. With this we will have multiple views that the user can sort the information through by
people, planets, etc. There are lots of items for all of these so we will have a recycler view
implemented so that the information doesnâ€™t have to continue being reloaded each time. We will
also implement a planet size checker. This will be where you input two planets (possibly
selecting from a list) and then it will tell you which planet is bigger. Lastly, we will make sure
we implement the lifecycle methods to ensure out activity rata is handle appropriately.
